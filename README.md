# Byte-le Royale AI 2018
 
AI developed for the first ever NDSU ADC Byte-le Royale. The AI was built to manage resources for a party of adventurers, as well as to decide which moves they would use in combat. Within the Dungeon Delvers game, the AI had to maneuver around procedural traps, puzzles, and encounters with different monsters--all with their own AI. In between dungeon runs, the AI determined the best upgrades for the party. My team placed 2nd with our design, with me serving as technical writer and lead strategist.
